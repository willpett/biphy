     * Object describing a conditional clade probability distribution.

     * A conditional clade is a clade given its parent clade.
     * The conditional clade probability distribution describes the entire set of 
     * conditional clades encountered in a tree distribution.
     * To do so it contains a vector of taxons, found in all trees,
     * a vector of bitvectors giving presence/absence of taxons in clades.
