/** This function calculates the stationary frequencies of the rate matrix. The
 rate matrix, Q, is the infinitesimal generator of the Markov chain. It is an
 n X n matrix whose off-diagonal elements are q_ij >= 0 and whose diagonal elements
 are specified such that each row sums to zero. The rate matrix is finite (has
 a fixed number of states) and we assume that the input matrix is irreducible, as
 is the usual case for substitution models. Because Q is irreducible and finite,
 it has a stationary distribution, pi, which is a row vector of n probabilities.
 The stationary probabilities can be calculated by solving the homogeneous system
 of equations, pi*Q = 0, where 0 is a vector of zeros.
 
 We do the following to calculate the stationary frequencies. 
 
 1. We perform an LU decomposition of the transpose of the matrix Q.
 
 Q' = LU
 
 2. Now we set Ux = z (x will eventually hold the stationary probabilities). 
 Because L is nonsingular, we have z = 0. We proceed to back substitute on
 Ux = z = 0. When u_nn = 0, we can put in any solution for x. Here, we put
 in x_n = 1. We then solve the other values of x through back substitution.
 
 3. The solution obtained in 2 is not a probability vector. We normalize the
 vector such that the sum of the elements is 1.
 
 Note that the only time we need to use this function is when we don't
 know the stationary frequencies of the rate matrix beforehand. For most
 substitution models used in molecular evolution, the stationary frequencies
 are built into the rate matrix itself. These models are time-reversible.
 This function is useful for the non-reversible models.

 probabilities of a rate matrix, see:

 finite irreducible Markov chains. In "Advances in Computational
 Probability", W. Grassmann, ed. Kluwer Academic Publishers. */
